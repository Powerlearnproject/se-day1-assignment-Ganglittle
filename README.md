## **Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment**

## **Part 1**: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**

Software Engineering is essentially the building blocks of a system, app or program. It involves planning, design, development and testing products to do various tasks.

Because it is the fundamental building blocks of the creation and evolution of technology, it plays a crucial role in the technology industry. It ensures that projects are done efficiently, making sure to account for cost, scalability and time management.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

1. 1940s to 1950s - The First low-level computers like ENIAC and UNIVAC came to be. Instructions coded manually through methods like punch cards by programmers.
2. Late 1960s to 1980s - The birth of LISP,  and the term 'Software Engineering'. Personal computers went into circulation
3. 1990s to 2000s - The Age of the Internet. Websites appeared in the early 90s that led to the Browser Wars.

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**
* Requirements: Understanding the software's use and acquiring information on its requirements.
* Design: Creating blueprints for how the software will work and developing the User Interface and User Experience Design.
* Implementation: The coding stage. Writing and optimizing code 
* Testing: Inolves testing, troubleshooting and ensuring that software meets all the requirements.
* Deployment: Releasing the software to clients and consumers.
* Maintenance: Fixing any issues and bugs and collecting user feedback

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

Both Waterfall and Agile methodologies are project management methodologies with the goal of delivering high-quality software, but their SDLC models vary.

The **Agile Methodology** focuses on continuous improvement. The order is flexible and the process is a continuous loop of testing and feedback. This makes it easier to alter the software to suit the clients' needs. Can lead to scope creep.

The **Waterfall Methodology** follows a fixed order and ensures that each phase is completed before moving on to the next (it is sequential). There is rarely any change to the requirements after they are initially acquired. Can lead to bugs and issues being found late.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

* **Software Developer** - Writes and maintains the code, and implements software solutions.
* **Quality Assurance Engineer** - Ensure the software's quality assurance by making sure it is reliable and meet requirements.
* **Project Manager** - Oversees the project phases and ensures it stays within the designated timeframe and budget.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

**Integrated Development Environments** are software applications that provide tools and features for writing, testing, and debugging code, all in one application. Without it, programmers would have to install multiple tools and spend more time transferring information from one tool to another, or trying to integrate information from one language or format to the other. Examples are Visual Studio, NetBeans and Eclipse.

**Version Control Systems** are systems that track the changes made to code. It allows multiple programmers to work on the same project without overwriting one another, and ensures that the project is not lost or corrupted because the latest version has an error. Examples are Git, AWS CodeCommit and SVN.

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

1. Changing Requirements - A change in requirements can lead to the deletion of code (time wasted) or scope creep.
   
2. Tight Deadlines - Projects have strict deadlines and the coding process may not be so smooth.
   
3. Technical Debt - shortcuts taken during the coding process can make it harder to troubleshoot or implement new features.

4. New Technology - New programmes and tools come up frequently, forcing programmers to keep up with the trends.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

## **Part 2**: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

Prompt engineering is creating questions that give the best responses from AI models. This is important because the AI therefore generates more accurate responses and executes tasks correctly, which saves its user time.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**

**Vague prompt**: Generate a picture of a bowl of apples, brown background.

**Clearer prompt**: Generate a picture of a bowl of fresh red apples. The bowl has a dark wood texture. Background is a warm brown, with soft lighting for a cozy feel.
